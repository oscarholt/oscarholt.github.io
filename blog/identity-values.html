    <h3 class="blog-h3">Core Personal Values</h3>
    <p>My core personal values tend to be centered around growth. To me growing is
      one of the most important values to me right now as I always feel I have room to
      learn and improve and enjoy the process of harnessing new skills and honing
      ones I already have. Part of this involves being humble and adopting a learners
      mindset which is a big value for me and something I often struggled with in
      the past.</p>
    <p>A decision I have to make many times is when I am teaching
      kickboxing classes, and a student appears to be struggling with some form of
      technique or movement. Generally I have to weigh up the value of critiquing them
      in the hopes that it will lead to their improvement, versus the value of simply
      encouraging them and trying to raise their confidence which may be more helpful
      in the long run. Although it does vary from person to person, generally I try
      to offer advice as this is part of the job I am trying to do. Most of the time
      the students can take it well, but sometimes the consequences of this are that
      the student take a small blow to their ego, or be overwhelmed by the new
      information when they are already grappling with what they currently know. This
      can often times have the adverse effect and by lowering the students confidence
      potentially means they may even struggle more with whatever they were trying to
      do in the first place. </p>
    <p>My culture has influenced my values and identity profoundly. My parents always
      encouraged me to learn and be open minded towards trying new things, but
      also to be disciplined and practice things well, such as when I took music
      lessons or other extra-cirricular activities. At my high school there was a large
      emphasis placed on academic achievement which influenced me to value
      achievement more generally as a good goal or direction to want to move in.
      My friends are all a similar way in terms of enjoying the pursuit of learning
      and bettering themselves, which definitely rubs off on me and engrains the
      mentality of wanting to grow even further.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-h3">Strengths and Limitations</h3>
    <p>My strengths in my learning and career development would be being open minded,
      having a good learning mindset, rational thinking and creating and achieving
      goals. My limitations would be having my standards set too high, impatience and
      being overly critical of myself and others.</p>
    <p>I believe most of these strengths will help me in my learning journey,
      particularly being enthusiastic about learning and setting and achieving goals.
      This will intersect with learning obstacles such as having to learn things I
      have no experience with, having a large workload and managing my own learning.
    </p>
    <p>An example of trying to work productively with others was during my university
      assignments which involved working on a group project where we were programming
      an autonomous vehicle. There was resistance and tension when a few group
      members had disagreements about allegedly plagarising code from friends which
      was making it difficult to move ahead with the project. At the time I tried to
      resolve it by talking to each of them individually and explaining the other
      persons perspective in a way that seemed more neutral so they could each
      understand the other persons reasons for feeling / acting a certain way.
      I would say this was somewhat effective as we did manage to complete and pass
      the project. I would try a slightly different strategy now of mediating a
      discussion between them as this would hopefully allow for a much clearer
      resolution of the conflict as they are face to face and can hopefully get
      a better idea of the issues each person presents. This is because it would
      not be as much of a band-aid solution, but more of a solution that would work
      long term and help the group members to work together in the future even outside
      of the current project.</p>
