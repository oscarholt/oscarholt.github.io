    <h2 class="blog-h2">Problem Solving</h2>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">16/07/2021</h3>

    <p>I got blocked on a problem where I needed to write a function that would
      basically loop through an array and find an object in it that contained a
      certain property. The issue was I couldnt understand why when my function
      was given an undefined object (an empty array) my function was not handling it
      properly and the console kept telling me I had the wrong output when I was
      sure I was handling it correctly. </p>

    <p>It came down to using a mixture of pseudocode and googling to look at other
      ways functions handled the undefined object. First by using pseudocode I realised
      that my function should indeed handle undefined objects, I could also see this
      by console logging the objects that were put into my function in the tests
      and it showed that two of them were undefined. After googling ways to handle
      undefined objects in javascript I saw a piece of code that returned 0 as a
      way to break the loop in the function.</p>

    <p>After trying this I realised that I had
      to return 0 when the object was undefined even though this didn't really make
      sense to me from a development perspective because the function was returning
      the address that the property was in, and returning 0 as an address could be
      confusing rather than just saying "You passed in an array with nothing in it".
    </p>

    <p>
      During the process I felt a frustrated because I couldn't seem to find the
      reason my code wasn't working despite it passing all of the other tests.
      Once I realised the answer I felt relieved and also a little bit foolish that
      I didn't try something so simple earlier.</p>

    <p>
      I guess I realised that generally I always look for the most potentially
      complicated problems instead of starting with the easiest fixes first. This
      has taught me to try to work from the ground up in debugging rather than starting
      at the worst case scenario. This would be a lot more time efficient and eliminates
      difficulties like mine where you get something simple wrong but spend more time
      than needed to figure it out.</p>

    <p>A problem I solved in an elegant way was a problem where I had to write a
      function to capitalise the first letter of every word in a string. I solved
      it by googling and experimenting with the different built in javascript methods.</p>

    <p>My solution meant that all the code was in a return statement which was
      quite efficient and I was pleased that through my understanding I could condense
      what seemed initially like a multi-step process into one line of code that
      was still readable but also very compact. I returned the string which was
      put into lowercase and split up into an array by the space (" ") character.
      I then used a map to take every string in this array, replace the first character
      with a capitalised version and add the rest of the string onto it. Finally I
      rejoined the strings after they had all been mapped with a space in between.
      Here is the final piece of code I wrote:</p>

    <p>return str.toLowerCase().split(' ').map(s => s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.substring(1)).join(' ');</p>

    <p>This made me feel like I had a solid understanding of the material so I was
      pretty happy afterwards and feeling like I had learnt the content well. I
      learnt that creating elegant solutions is all about having a deeper understanding
      of the components to that solution so that you can use these components together
      much more effectively and efficiently.</p>
