    <h2 class="blog-h2">Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">12/07/2021</h3>

    <h3 class="blog-h3">Neuroplasticity</h3>
    <p>Neuroplasticity gives people the confidence to know that their brain has the potential
      to change and adapt which helps them in learning and developing skills required
      for their career or everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>Mainly this applies to me in the form of learning new skills. I would apply it
      by ensuring that I am challenging myself and my brain to create a new 'path'
      for my neurons to wire so that that path can be strengthened and therefore
      my ability or skill will increase.
    </p>
    <p>To increase neuroplasticity, firstly an understanding of neuroplasticity itself helps, but also both sleep
      and exercise have been shown to play important roles in growth in the brain.
      Optimising your sleep by creating a healthy sleep cycle and getting 7-8 hours
      of quality sleep per night would be helpful, as well as ensuring you are
      exercising regularly, possibly by going for a walk before you begin learning
      or at some point during every day.

    <h3 class="blog-h3">Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>A growth mindset is essentially the idea that intelligence can be developed
as opposed to a fixed mindset where the idea is that intelligence is static.
A growth mindset is relevant in any learning situation as it promotes
an attitude towards learning which results in better perseverance and overall
success.</p>
    <p>Personally I had done quite a bit of research into this before, so I was already
quite familiar and try to regularly apply a growth mindset to anything I am
trying to learn. Some of the studies did suprise me in finding that children
even at a kindergarten age could be positively impacted by learning about
having a growth mindset and applying it to their education.
</p>
    <p>Every time I get stuck on something or find something difficult to understand
I will try to remember that this challenge I am experiencing will eventually
lead to me 'getting smarter' or developing my skills in this area further.
Therefore instead of avoiding challenges and difficult concepts I will try to
seek them out to make sure I am always challenging myself and learning as much
as I possibly can.</p>
