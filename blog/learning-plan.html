    <p>My long term goal is to be able to get a job working in the web development /
      front-end development space, just to get a feel for what this type of work is
      about and see if it is something I want to pursue moving forward.</p>
    <p>My strengths would be my mindset, rational thinking and setting / achieving
      goals and milestones. My limitations are sometimes setting standards too high,
      being impatient and overly critical of myself.
    </p>
    <p>I would like to see my leadership skills developed at EDA, and be more confident
      in being able to communicate my ideas with a group and help to align people
      towards a common goal. </p>
    <p>I will manage my workload in this programme by using the pomodorro technique
      where I work in 25 minute increments with 5 minute breaks in between. I will
      manage my time by using timeboxing and tracking the time I spend on different
      components of the course with Toggl. When I get stuck I will force myself to
      ask for help as this is something I need to work on. I will ask either the
      foundations channel on Slack or one of the facillitators if needed when I cannot
      help myself by first searching Google etc. When things are building up and
      starting to get to me I will try to let one of the facilitators know and hopefully
      forumulate with them a way for me to prioritise and chunk out the work ahead
      of me into a more manageable structure. </p>
    <p>I would say what I would expect from the facilitation team would just be to
      be good listeners and maybe not neccessarily give me answers but more so give
      me clarity and a direction to move in if I get stuck. I also would expect they
      could bring a good overarching perspective and help me prioritise parts of the
      course that are really important over those that are less so. Lastly I would
      expect that they would be able to give me some insights from their experiences
      as programmers that might help me gain some perspective that I would not get
      as somebody just starting out.</p>
    <p>
      Scheduling wise I pretty much have the whole day free, I spend 1 hour at the
      gym 3 days a week and train / work at a muay thai gym probably 4-5 times a week
      at around 5-6pm so past this time I would allocate to other things like muay
      thai, gym, cooking etc.</p>
