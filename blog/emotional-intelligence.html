    <h3 class="blog-h3">05/07/2021</h3>

    <p>Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is basically how aware you are of the emotions
      and feelings of both yourself and others. It essentially relates to how well
      somebody can control their own emotions and understand when their actions are
      being affected by their emotions, and in what way. It also describes how someone
      might be able to perceive and understand the emotions of others, and what the
      causes and consequences of that emotion are in terms of that persons actions.</p>
    <p>The reason emotional intelligence seems important to me, is that while you may
      be able to solve problems quickly and grasp concepts faster than others with a
      high IQ, having a low EQ means your performance is just as easily diminished
      if you are, for example, feeling frustrated, angry or sad. Being unable to
      recognise when your emotions are affecting your actions or performance leads
      to a lot of frustrating situations in my own personal experience.</p>
    <p>The other reason emotional intelligence is important to me is simply because
      of the nature of the world we live in. Nearly every job requires some degree
      of social skills and social interaction, and without EQ it would be very
      difficult to navigate a work environment which requires social skills to be
      able to present your work, work as a team or communicate with supervisors /
      people higher in the ladder. </p>
    <p>Overall I believe that EQ is something quite critical especially in todays world,
      and during this devacademy course I definitely want to try and apply more concepts
      from this idea to help enhance my leadership and communication skills. I plan
      to do this through mindfulness meditation and journalling. </p>
