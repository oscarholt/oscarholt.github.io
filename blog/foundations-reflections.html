    <h2 class="blog-h2">Foundations Reflections</h2>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">26/07/2021</h3>

    <h3 class="blog-h3">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result
      of the core learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
I have learned that I tend to set high expectations and therefore underestimate
myself a lot as a result especially in terms of my programming ability, I
learnt that my mindset and mentality are critical in determining how fast I can
learn or even if I can learn a new skill, and that having emotional intelligence
is highly important in any field of life no matter how it seems to favour
traditional intelligence or IQ.</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning or programming?</h3>
    <p>I think that in programming you are constantly faced with challenges, even the
easiest problems can create bugs if you aren't paying your full attention, and
so therefore you are often dealing with a lot of tedious debugging and frustration.
I think that being aware of this is critical in being a consistenly good programmer
as it is easy to let your emotions get the better of you and get angry, both
at yourself and potential people you are working with too who might be facing
similar issues on seemingly straightforward tasks. I think having values is important
too as often it can be easy to get lost in the idea that the best programmers are
the ones who can write the shortest code, or solve problems the fastest, when
in reality I think that programmers who are able to be objective about their
ability and self aware are usually the most successful as they are unlikely to
be inhibited by their ego.</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">What has suprised you the most about the core learining?</h3>
    <p>I was really fascinated with the neuroplasticity and mindset sections especially
the research that was put into them, it allowed me to reflect on past
endavours in my life and how I might have been successfull or failed, I tended
to notice that these mindsets often have correlated with success in my life
previously, and it helped me pinpoint why other things may not have worked out
as I hoped by evaluating what my mindset was in those moments of learning.</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>I think generally just sharing my reflections and ideas with other people was
pretty daunting at first (and maybe still is). I do a lot of thinking about
myself but never tend to share these ideas with other people which creates
several challenges mainly trying to verbalise what I am actually thinking in a
way that someone else can understand it properly.
</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
      core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
      <p>I would say because programming is a field where you are constantly needing to
learn and absorb new information, it makes sense to focus not on the information
itself but the ability to learn and retain new things comfortably and
consistently. This can be an especially hard thing to do because you can always
feel like you are a beginner or seeing something for the first time. I think having
the tools to cope with these kinds of experiences regularly is a huge benefit in
the industry and probably helps a lot with things like mental health as well, and
I can imagine would be vital in the longevity of people's careers.
</p>
    <h3 class="blog-h3">
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
      Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?
    </h3>
    <p>I think it feels like a good use of time. I like that it adds a more human
aspect to coding whereas in the past it feels like coding is treated more like a
maths or science type of subject where all that matters is the data and
results. I think that developing the self awareness in any sort of subject is
really valuable and understanding what is happening under the hood of your brain
when you are trying to learn something new will help with things like
getting stuck or not understanding something properly.</p>
